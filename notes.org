#+TITLE: Notes

* =chicago=
Immediate observation: ggplot kind of "just knows" what to do with dates or
strings (or perhaps this is part of the csv reader?) whereas w/ =plot= I am
currently in the process of digging up how to get dates to work and I had to
=map string->number=

I had to wrangle the CSV by hand -- there isn't interoperation between =plot=
and =csv-reading=. Also it looks like =csv= on the Racket package index is...
almost useless

There's nothing to parse dates, and since I'm currently attempting to turn my
brain off and think in the mind of an R programmer, I'm using the =gregor=
library for this. Also note that I actually, again, have to parse the date
whereas it's magically(tm) handled in ggplot2

The font family names in racket/draw don't really make any sense (why is
monospace "modern"?)

Subtitle? Caption? Figure tag?
